## Notes

There are two Javascript bindings to gnome.  gjs based on Mozilla
SpiderMonkey, and seed based of Webkit.  See
https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/BindingsDocumentation for
more details.

Note that some of the above documentation is from seed projects, and
so isn't quite what we need, (I'm assuming gjs, for the moment), but
is very close.  Be aware.
